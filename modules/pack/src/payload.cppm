// and, having already verified what it just built, at the end of assembling) and its `--from`
// (copy an already-assembled payload, keeping the executable bits, then verify the copy). The
// layout is the contract the server and the editor extensions rely on:
//
//     <payload>/
//       payload.json                  versions and relative paths of the three parts
//       bin/mcppls[.exe]
//       mcxx/resource/include/...     the mcxx engine's builtin headers (mcppls.pack.resource)
//       clangd/bin/clangd[.exe]        optional: the clangd engine
//       clangd/lib/clang/<major>/include/...
//       kit/kit.json + kit data        (spec S4)
//       licenses/                      mcppls and LLVM license texts
